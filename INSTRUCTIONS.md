## Ubuntu
Run «install.sh» and wait 1 minute and you will now be able to run the application. If you don't know how to run it go to the folder where «install.sh» is stored, right-click and select «Open in Terminal», there type «./install.sh».

To uninstall the application run «uninstall.sh» (it only will delete the shortcut and your preferences)

For delete the whole application run «totaluninstall.sh», be careful because this will delete the folder where «totaluninstall.sh» is stored, howevere you can restore it from trash.

## Windows
In windows you simply have to open the «DailyDoseOfJapaneseWindows» folder and run the «.exe» file.


If you can't install the application or you're getting problems see https://github.com/Patitotective/Daily-Dose-Of-Japanese/wiki/Help or contact me.

## Ubuntu
Run «install.sh» and wait 1 minute and you will now be able to run the application. If you don't know how to run it go to the folder where «install.sh» is stored, right-click and select «Open in Terminal», then type «./install.sh».

To uninstall the application run «./uninstall.sh» (it will delete only the shortcut and your preferences)

For delete the whole application run «./totaluninstall.sh», be careful because this will delete the folder where the app is stored, howevere you can restore it from trash.

## Windows
In windows you simply have to open the «DailyDoseOfJapaneseWindows» folder and run the «.exe» file.


If you can't install the application or you're getting problems see https://github.com/Patitotective/Daily-Dose-Of-Japanese/wiki/Help or contact me.
